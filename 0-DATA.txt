1.
+ hi. i want to write a python code. with admin(user) pannel. 
I want to run this app on kali linux, for now. 
but in future it will be an api that sends data to people on the web. 
so, this is the plan: 
I want to build 6 version of this app, step by step, 
and you baby gonna help me in that. 
now for version1 of "DayanaCryptoTrader" 
(that is the app name, be carefull she is very sensitive)  
we gonna work just on "tether to persian Toman", just this. 
you know we can use the real time dollar price in iran, for start, 
then maybe in version 5 and 6 we use economy and politic analyzes and 
their effect on dollar price. but for now we can just get the free data 
from other people and robots and models, as we can and give the user some 
choices with charts using pandas, numpy and ofcurse matplotlib. 
but remember if you have any better idea, Im all ears. just be carefull,
I dont wanna pay money for version 1 or 2.
 but I can spend a few boxes for version 3, 
 if it gives me benefit. now, lets start, what should I do, 
 what is in your mind?


- To start building your "DayanaCryptoTrader" application, 
we'll focus on the first version, which will involve fetching 
real-time dollar prices in Iran and presenting them to the user with some basic analysis and visualization. This version will be designed to run on Kali Linux and will be a command-line interface (CLI) application. We'll use Python for the backend, leveraging libraries like requests for fetching data, pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib for data visualization.

pip3 install requests pandas numpy matplotlib

Plus Hello World.py

+ ok , I just add 1-get-dollar-price.py => todo (fix the code and send to you)
ok. go for next step

- .....

+ ok ok ok, lets cut the crap and go for selenium instead of bs4 


- ok => To replace the requests and BeautifulSoup (bs4) with Selenium for web scraping, you'll need to install Selenium and a WebDriver for the browser you intend to use (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome). Selenium allows you to automate browser actions, which can be useful for interacting with JavaScript-heavy websites or for navigating through pages that require user interaction.

First, ensure you have Selenium installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

pip install selenium

Next, download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser. For Chrome, you can download ChromeDriver from here. Make sure to download the version that matches your browser version.

Once you have Selenium and the WebDriver installed, you can modify your get_dollar_price_in_iran function to use Selenium. Here's how you can do it:

*** code is in the selenium_file.py


+  webdriver_manager.chrome" could not be resolved

- pip install webdriver_manager

+ ok one problem. Im using kali linux and I dont have chrome. refactor the code please.

- Given that you're using Kali Linux and don't have Google Chrome installed, you can use Firefox as an alternative browser for Selenium. Firefox is a popular open-source browser that works well with Selenium. You'll need to install the Firefox WebDriver (GeckoDriver) and the webdriver_manager package for Python.

First, ensure you have Firefox installed on your system. If not, you can install it using the following command:

sudo apt-get install firefox

Next, install the webdriver_manager package if you haven't already:

pip install webdriver_manager

Now, let's refactor your code to use Firefox with Selenium. Here's how you can modify the get_dollar_price_in_iran function to use Firefox:

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime

def get_dollar_price_in_iran():
    # Setup WebDriver
    webdriver_service = Service(GeckoDriverManager().install())
    driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=webdriver_service)

    # Navigate to the website
    url = "https://nobitex.ir/"
    driver.get(url)

    # Assuming the prices are in elements with specific IDs or classes
    # You'll need to inspect the website to find the correct selectors
    dollar_price_element = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "text-title fw-bold fs-14-sm fs-18-md ml-1")
    
    if dollar_price_element:
        # Extract the prices
        dollar_price = dollar_price_element.text
        driver.quit() # Close the browser
        return dollar_price
    else:
        print("Failed to find price elements.")
        driver.quit() # Close the browser
        return None

def analyze_and_visualize(price):
    # For simplicity, we'll use the current date and time for the plot
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    
    # Convert data to a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame([{'Date': current_date, 'Price': price}])
    
    # Basic visualization
    plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Price'])
    plt.title('Dollar Price in Iran Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Price (IRR)')
    plt.show()

def hello_world():
    dollar_price_in_iran = get_dollar_price_in_iran()
    print(f"The current dollar price in Iran is: {dollar_price_in_iran} IRR")
    analyze_and_visualize(dollar_price_in_iran)

hello_world()

This code uses Selenium with Firefox to fetch the dollar price in Iran. Make sure to replace the class name "text-title fw-bold fs-14-sm fs-18-md ml-1" with the actual class name or ID of the element containing the dollar price on the website you're scraping. You can find this by inspecting the website's HTML source code.

This should work on Kali Linux without requiring Google Chrome. The webdriver_manager package will automatically handle the download and setup of the Firefox WebDriver (GeckoDriver) for you.
