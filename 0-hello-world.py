# This code does the following:

#     Fetches the current dollar price in Iran using the get_dollar_price_in_iran function.
#     Prints the fetched price.
#     Calls the analyze_and_visualize function to plot the price over time. For simplicity, it uses the current date and time as the date for the plot.

# Please note, the API URL used in the get_dollar_price_in_iran function is just an example. You might need to find a reliable source for real-time dollar prices in Iran, as the availability and accuracy of such data can vary.

# This integration should replace the placeholder "Hello, world!" message with real functionality, fetching and displaying real-time dollar prices in Iran along with a simple plot.
